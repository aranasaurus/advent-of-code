# 2024
I'm gonna try doing this year in [Odin](https://odin-lang.org). I've poked around at Odin a little bit for some Game dev stuff, and I like how low level it is combined with how small/simple it is. I want to challenge myself to try to solve the puzzles with a low level language. I say "try" here, because I've also been doing a lot of Rust recently (mostly using [Bevy](https://bevyengine.org) (again, games)), and I've done rust a couple of times in the past, but I still have a strong pull to get more experience with it outside of Bevy. So, if Odin ends up being too much of a challenge, I may switch to rust.

The other thing I'm focusing on this year is this repo itself. I don't have a specific goal other than having more to look back on than just the code in the future. I'd like this repo to work as kind of an Engineering Log for my Advent of Code adventures. So the initial idea was just to have PRs for each day in which I summarize the solution and how I got to it and that may be all I end up with, but after doing that for day 1, I wanted to experiment with Milestones, Issues, and maybe even Projects. I use Milestones and PRs at work, but we don't really use any of the rest of github's features.

Another difference for this year is I want to make it through all the days! I think the farthest I've ever made it was Day 18, but I usually do both parts every day, and end up burnt out by the end. This year I'm only going to focus on part 1 each day. I'll do part 2 as a stretch goal each day, but my primary goal is to get Part 1 for each day.

## Updates

### Day 1
See [PR](https://github.com/aranasaurus/advent-of-code/pull/2) for solution notes.

### Day 2
See [PR](https://github.com/aranasaurus/advent-of-code/pull/4) for solution notes. 

This is the one that really broke me. I spent hours trying to find a built-in way to remove an element at an index in an array in Odin. This brought me to the conclusion that having to implement algorithms like that would be a great learning experience and I do want to do it someday... but I don't currently have a project in mind that I want to do in Odin so the inspiration to do this learning _right now_ while trying to solve these puzzles at the same time is waning.

Plus, I do have a lot of inspiration for my current Rust project(s), so it's also drawing me over pretty hard.

### Day 3
Well, that didn't take long... I spent too much time on both of the first 2 days on trying to figure out how to do the most basic shit in Odin that I can already tell it's not compatible with my goal of finishing all the days.

So I'm switching to Rust starting today.
