# Advent of Code

These are (most of) my attempts at Advent of Code over the years. I say "most", because I did [2023 in GDScript](https://github.com/aranasaurus/advent-of-code-godot) and I shared that repo with my son and I think it's a good template repo on its own. Or it could be if I put some extra work into it anyway, but regardless I didn't want to pull it into this repo because I feel it has merit to stay in its own repo.

I really enjoy doing Advent of Code. I enjoy it for the challenge of figuring out how to solve the puzzles and I almost always do it in a language I want to learn or get more experience with. I never really compete leaderboard-wise, a couple of times I have concentrated on the speed of the solution itself, like the run-time, but I generally don't do that either.

Over the years that I have decided to participate I've generally started a new repo (or no repo at all) for each year. This year, 2024, however, I decided to move all of my previous attempts into this repo (my first AoC repo) and I want to start trying to keep some record of my journey through it every year. I'm not going to go back through previous years and try to remember what my focus was for them, but for this year and every year after I'd like to summarize my goals for the year in this readme. So here goes!

## [2024](./2024/README.md)
### Goals
 - Improve this repo as my all-the-years AoC repo. 
 - Do at least Part 1 for all 25 days.

I'm starting with [Odin](https://odin-lang.org), but I'm pretty sure I'll switch to [Rust](https://rustlang.org) pretty quickly.
